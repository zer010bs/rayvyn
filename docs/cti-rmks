RFC // cve-tool feeds
we currently reimplement a tool that monitors CVE-feeds/advisory-pages (step 1, already done), displays results on a searchable website (step 2, implementation) and alerts when certain thresholds are met (CVSS and/or CPE-matches). this tool will be free to use, i'd be happy to test the later alerting-mechanism with people from this channel.
